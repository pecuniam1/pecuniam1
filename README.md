### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe Kelly, and I am a full stack developer looking for new oppurtunities. I have a [website](https://www.joekellyonline.com) that I recently started and am adding to all the time. It's just a brief intro, but you can find the code for it right [here](https://www.gitbhub.com/pecuniam/joekellyonline)

I am getting my Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security. I previously worked as a full stack developer in PHP and AngularJS and am waiting to put my talents to use again.

Thanks for stopping by as I add more code and try to really demonstrate what I am capable of.
